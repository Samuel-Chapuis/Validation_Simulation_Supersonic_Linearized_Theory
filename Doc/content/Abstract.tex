	This paper presents a comparative study of various techniques to compute the Mach angle on a slope under supersonic conditions. The approaches are analyzed and benchmarked against the methodologies described in NASA Technical Paper 1406, with an emphasis on accuracy and computational efficiency. By exploring traditional and modern numerical methods within a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) framework, the study aims to highlight the strengths and limitations of each technique in predicting shock phenomena in supersonic flows.
