	This paper presents a computational study aimed at verifying the results obtained in a NASA Technical Paper 1406. Through careful implementation of numerical methods and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques, we reproduce and validate the the shock angle previously reported. The verification process includes detailed comparisons of flow characteristics and numerical solutions, providing insights into the reliability and accuracy of the original research.
