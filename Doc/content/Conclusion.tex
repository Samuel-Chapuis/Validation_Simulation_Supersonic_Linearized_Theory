\section{Conclusion}

To conlcude it is clear that the simulation and the numerical solution are extremely close. So in the range of the theory it is clear that the numerical solution is largely enough to understand the actual phenomena. In addition to that, the linearized theory is sufficient for small angles $<5^{\circ}$ and decent for angles $<10^{\circ}$.
