\section{Conclusion}

This study has demonstrated excellent agreement between the bisection‐based numerical solution of the exact oblique‐shock relation and high‐fidelity CFD simulations. Across all cases considered, the maximum deviation remains below 12\%, confirming that the numerical approach reliably captures shock‐angle behavior within the theoretical range. The small‐disturbance (linearized) theory provides an excellent approximation for deflection angles below \(5^\circ\) and remains reasonably accurate up to \(10^\circ\), beyond which non‐linear effects become significant.

Moreover, CFD proves particularly valuable in situations involving thermal coupling or non-stationary flow. When conjugate heat transfer or transient phenomena play a role, CFD’s ability to model heat exchange and time-dependent behavior offers insights that lie beyond the scope of steady, inviscid theoretical models.
